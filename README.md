# VaccineMgmtSystem
Developed a vaccine management system in C++. The system has two profiles: Admin and User. 

The Admin Profile includes a Login Page, a Dashboard for managing vaccine data, options to Add New Record, Search vaccine records, View All Data, and Update Vaccine Quantity. 

The User Profile includes a Login and Registration Page, the ability to Add New Record with personal details, Vaccine Registration information, and the option to View Details of their records. Users can also Exit the system.

Both profiles use file handling to store data in "data.txt" for vaccines and "users_data.txt" for user records.
